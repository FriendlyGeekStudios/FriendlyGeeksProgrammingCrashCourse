# Introductory Programming in C

The C language has been around since the late 60's although it saw the most development in 1972 and wasn't widely adopted until the late 80's. C is a rather minimal programming language in that it does not include a lot of useful, quality of life features provided by more modern languages. Aside from a few core data types and control flow structures, the C language provides practically nothing else, which makes it an excellent language for learning fundamental concepts as well has how some low-level innards of a program work and operate. We'll be exploring these fundamentals and then building on them to understand how more modern languages work for the convenience of the developer.

### Environment Setup
Let’s start by first creating an environment conducive to programming. I strongly encourage using [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) which you can install following this guide. You should also, if you don’t have it installed already, get [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Not Visual Studio!). Once you have both installed, open VS Code, and select File > Open Folder
